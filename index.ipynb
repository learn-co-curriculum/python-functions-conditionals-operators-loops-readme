    "# Conditionals, Loops, Operators, Functions: Bringing It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned about a lot of statements we have available to us in Python to write more dynamic and concise code. Conditionals let us create *conditions* that inform our code how to operate. Loops help us to dynamically iterate through and operate on a collection (i.e. a list or a dictionary). And Operators, generally, allow us to compare elements to each other, assert the sameness of elements, or return elements based on their truthiness or falsiness. Functions, essentially, help us to create an object that packages up one or more operations and allows us to execute those operations from anywhere else in scope in our code. However, as we can tell by the title of this lesson, we will now be focusing on using all of these smaller parts together. As we get further into our lives as programmers, we will find ourselves facing more and more complex problems and to solve those we will need these types of tools to create solutions while keeping our code concise and efficient.

    "With the above examples, we can see that deciding when to use functions, condtionals, operators, and loops all depends on the problem at hand. We can use context clues to give us a good idea of the structure our solution will take. If we have a condtion that would change the output of our return value, then we will need to use a conditional statement. If we have a nested data structure that we need to iterate over, we will need to use a nested loop. Likewise, if we need to compare two values, we'll need to use a some type of operator (i.e. comparison, logical, identity, etc.). Knowing how and when to use these tools will greatly reduce the amount of code we write as well as greatly increase the efficiency of the code we write."
